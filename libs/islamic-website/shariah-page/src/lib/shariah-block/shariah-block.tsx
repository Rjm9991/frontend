        that provides smart contract developers and web2 businesses a way to
        prove their ethical relevance for Muslim users by listing their
        products/services on the HAQQ Wallet.

        interact only with whitelisted, Sharia-compliant dApps. Thus whilst
        being a place where anyone can deploy their dApp or project, HAQQ
